TODO:
--------
[ ] Try with word penalization and large vocabulary size
[ ] Goal predictions(relative to yourself and agent index)
[ ] Batching
[ ] Add a test mode where utterances are argmaxed instead of Gumbel-softmaxed
[ ] Testing after some initial training
    [ ] Test in simple case, agent goes to its goal
    [ ] Test in 2-agent case, something is uttered and agents go towards uttered goals
    [ ] Test in 2-agent, no-utteraces case, see what the agents do
[ ] Add a way to "replay" an episode easily

LEARNING END:
-------------
[ ] Try relative goals (left of landmark, above landmark), see if relative direction words evolve
[ ] Give different award coefficients to goals, have a single agent have multiple goals, see if award values can be communicated

DISTANT FUTURE:
--------------
[ ] Visualization of a game
[ ] Web interface to give an initial game state and see how the agents act and what they utter


Unstructured thoughts:
----------------
- Color words
  - Simulate different visual systems, see how color words evolve
- Verbs
  - GO
  - TAKE (i.e. make landmarks movable, have a goal be the moving of a landmark to another landmark)
- Make sequential goals (i.e. go to blue, then green) and also multi-landmark but not ordered goals (go to green and blue in any order). See if a way to discriminate evolves
- Narration (Agent A observes a certain environment, tries to describe it to Agent B, Agent B predicts the environment history)
